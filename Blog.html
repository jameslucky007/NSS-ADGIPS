    <h1>The Rakshin Project: Raising Awareness on Child Abuse and the POCSO Act</h1>
    <p>On September 24, 2024, the Rakshin Project conducted an impactful awareness event at the ADGIPS Auditorium, where over 210 participants gathered to discuss a pressing social issue—child abuse and the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act.
